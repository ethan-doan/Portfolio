            <p>
                I am a passionate, ambitious, and creative Junior here at Creighton University. I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Fintech and am driven to discover the implementations of computer science towards financial markets. I am actively seeking to further my understanding and proficiency in these areas while building relationships with others. I have been fortunate enough to gain experience through multiple internships where I have been able to implement my studies in practice while having opportunities to learn and thrive within new environments. In my spare time I enjoy reading, spending time with friends and family, and consistently trying to learn new things.

            <p class="text-secondary">While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions. Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station. Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).</p>

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form. Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.</p>
